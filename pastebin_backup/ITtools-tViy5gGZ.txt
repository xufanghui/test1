Version 1.0

				Introduction

This package is a collection of programs, apps, utilities, hacks, and know-how
that are meant to make your computing a bit more... interesting. Whether you're
an avid IT Specialist, the family computer tech, or simply a troll looking for
new tools to use, there's something here for you. 
A majority of these applications are meant for PC use, but there are SOME *nix
and Mac applications included, as well.
It should be noted that some of the files in this package ARE of questionable
legality. 
I should probably say something about how this package is for 
educational purposes, but fuck it. That shit's for cop-outs, anyway. I'm 
pro-piracy and anti-establishment, and as far as computing laws are concerned,
not a single fuck is given.

Raise some hell, boys.
